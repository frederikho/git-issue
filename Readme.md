# Git issue

In this repo, I try to implement the tutorial from [here](http://timstaley.co.uk/posts/making-git-and-jupyter-notebooks-play-nice/). It doesn't work as the filter don't seem to be applied. 


```git checkout jupyter/exploration.ipynb``` should clean the output of the cells in the Jupyter notebook.
